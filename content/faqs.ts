    id: "which-service",

    question: "How do I know which service fits my needs?",
    answer:
      "Book a Business Consultation. We'll talk through what you need and recommend the right service, or a combination of services, before any work starts.",
  },
  {
    id: "see-examples",
    group: "services",
    question: "Can I see examples of your work first?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Each service links to related case studies, samples or live demos. Samples we built ourselves are clearly labelled as Demo Projects.",

    question: "What's the difference between live and recorded courses?",
    answer:
      "Recorded courses are self-paced: you learn on your own schedule after enrolling, with module progress tracking and defined support. Live courses run in fixed batches with a class schedule, instructor-led Q&A and recordings according to the course terms.",

    question: "Does the research writing course guarantee publication?",
    answer:
      "No. You get structured lessons, mentoring and feedback on your draft, but no course can guarantee publication or acceptance. Your results, references and citations must be your own verified work.",

    id: "after-delivery",
    group: "support",
    question: "What happens after my project is delivered?",
    answer:

    answer:
      "After you send a booking request, our team checks availability and confirms the time by email. A request isn't confirmed until you receive that email.",

    id: "pricing-structure",
    group: "pricing",
    question: "How is pricing structured?",
    answer:
      "Depending on the service, we offer fixed packages, custom quotes or monthly support. Every proposal lists the deliverables, revisions, support period and any additional costs.",

    id: "third-party-costs",
    group: "pricing",
    question: "Are advertising, tool and hosting costs included?",
