# AIDMBD International Ltd — Website Requirements & Build Plan

> This is the single source of truth for building the AIDMBD website. It draws on three sources: the 13-page Bangla plan (AIDMBD_Website_Complete_Plan.pdf), the hero-section design reference and the company logo.
> Build it phase by phase (§17). Every step has a **Done when** check.
> **Before each step, read the listed guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.** This is Next.js 16.4 and its APIs differ from older versions (see AGENTS.md).

## 1. Project snapshot

| | |
|---|---|
| Company | AIDMBD International Ltd |
| Positioning | **AI Solutions, Digital Development & Practical Learning** |
| Core message | Make business work simpler with AI, build digital products that grow, and teach AI through real projects |
| Two halves | **Business Services**, which generates client inquiries, and **AIDMBD Learning Academy**, which generates course enrollments. **Booking** links both to a conversation. |
| Audiences | Business clients · students and beginners · research learners · teachers · university and corporate teams |
| Tagline (footer) | PRACTICAL AI. REAL BUSINESS IMPACT. |

### Tech stack
- Already installed:
  - **Next.js 16.4.3**: App Router, Turbopack, `cacheComponents: true`, `partialPrefetching: true`
  - **React 19.3** and **TypeScript** (strict), with the `@/*` path alias
  - **Tailwind CSS v4**: CSS-first configuration with `@theme` in `app/globals.css` (there is no `tailwind.config.js`)
- To add:
  - `motion`: Framer Motion under its current package name. Import from `"motion/react"`.
  - `lucide-react`: line icons, matching the reference's copper outline icons.
- Keep dependencies minimal. No UI kit, no CSS-in-JS. `cn()` in `lib/cn.ts` wraps `tailwind-merge`, so a `className` passed to a primitive reliably overrides its defaults (added in Phase 1 after plain class-joining let `inline-flex` beat `hidden`).

## 2. Primary user journeys

| Visitor | Journey |
|---|---|
| Business client | Home → Services → Service Details → Case Study → **Book a Consultation** |
| Student | Home → Learning Academy → Category → Course Details → **Enroll / Join Waitlist** → Dashboard (later) |
| Research learner | Academy → Research Writing syllabus → Mentorship or class details → **Booking or Enrollment** |

Every page ends with a clear next step along one of these paths.

---

## 3. Design system

Taken from the hero reference image and the logo.

### 3.1 Visual direction
- **Warm near-black canvas** with a soft **copper radial glow** behind the hero subject.
- A thin **copper elliptical orbit line** with glowing nodes, echoing the logo's orbit ring. This is the site's signature motif. Use it sparingly: in the hero, as section accents and in the CTA band.
- Headlines are **titanium white**, with key phrases in a **copper gradient** (e.g. "Human vision. / *Intelligent futures.*").
- **Eyebrow labels**: a short copper rule, then small uppercase text with wide letter-spacing. Part of the text can be copper.
- **Cards**: transparent dark surface, 1px copper hairline border at low opacity, `rounded-xl`, copper icon, circular arrow button.
- **Buttons** come in two styles, both with a → arrow:
  - Primary: filled copper.
  - Secondary: copper outline.
- Long-form reading (course syllabi, blog, policies) uses calm, plain areas: a slightly lifted surface, `max-w-prose` and no glow.
- Use real project screenshots. No generic stock imagery.

### 3.2 Color tokens
Define these in `app/globals.css` under `@theme`. The site has a **single dark theme**, so remove the scaffold's `prefers-color-scheme` switch and the Arial body font.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ink-950` | `#0A0A0B` | Page background |
| `ink-900` | `#111113` | Alternate section background |
| `ink-800` | `#18181B` | Cards, surfaces |
| `ink-700` | `#232327` | Inputs, strong borders |
| `line` | `rgb(255 255 255 / 0.08)` | Hairlines, dividers |
| `titanium-50` | `#F5F6F7` | Headlines, primary text |
| `titanium-300` | `#C8CCD2` | Titanium gradient end, secondary text |
| `titanium-500` | `#9A9FA6` | Body/muted text (7.4:1 on `ink-950`) |
| `copper-300` | `#F3B98A` | Gradient highlight |
| `copper-400` | `#E29A5F` | Links, hover, active nav, focus ring |
| `copper-500` | `#C8783F` | Accent text, icons, borders (5.9:1 on `ink-950`) |
| `copper-600` | `#A35D2C` | **Primary button fill** (white text 5:1) |
| `copper-700` | `#7A431F` | Button gradient end, glow base |

Gradients and effects:
- `--gradient-copper`: `linear-gradient(90deg, #F3B98A, #C8783F 55%, #A35D2C)`, for headline highlight text.
- `--gradient-titanium`: `linear-gradient(180deg, #FFFFFF, #C8CCD2)`, for headline text.
- `--glow-copper`: `radial-gradient(ellipse at center, rgb(200 120 63 / 0.35), transparent 60%)`.
- Card hover: border goes to `copper-500/60`, plus `box-shadow: 0 0 40px -10px rgb(200 120 63 / 0.45)`.

Rule: on hover, a primary button gets a glow. Don't lighten its fill, because a lighter fill drops white text below 4.5:1.

### 3.3 Typography
- **Plus Jakarta Sans** (`next/font/google`, weights 400–800) for everything. It's the closest free match to the reference's geometric headline.
- **Hind Siliguri** (400/500/600) joins the font stack when Bangla launches.
- Scale:

  | Element | Size | Weight | Notes |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | H1 | `clamp(2.75rem, 6vw, 5rem)` | 800 | Line-height 1.02, tracking -0.02em |
  | H2 | `clamp(2rem, 4vw, 3rem)` | 700 | |
  | H3 | 1.25–1.5rem | 600 | |
  | Body | 1rem–1.125rem | 400 | Line-height 1.6, `titanium-500` |
  | Eyebrow | 0.75rem | 500 | Uppercase, tracking 0.3em |

### 3.4 Layout
- Container: `max-w-7xl` (1280px) with gutters of `px-4` on mobile (16px), `md:px-8` and `lg:px-10`.
- Section rhythm: `py-20 md:py-28`. Each section has an eyebrow, an H2, an optional intro (`max-w-2xl`), then content.
- Breakpoints to verify: **360, 390, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440**. No horizontal scroll at any width.

### 3.5 Motion (Framer Motion via `motion/react`)
- Wrap the root in `<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">`, so reduced-motion users get no transforms.
- Shared feel:
  - Easing: `[0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]`
  - Durations: 0.4–0.7s
  - Stagger: 0.08s
  - No scroll-jacking, no parallax on text.
- Reusable primitives in `components/motion/`:
  - `<Reveal>`: fade in plus a 24px upward rise, `whileInView`, `once: true`, `amount: 0.25`.
  - `<Stagger>` / `<StaggerItem>`: staggered children for grids.
- Hero:
  - The **headline and subtitle use a CSS keyframe fade-up**, not JS. This lets them paint before hydration, which protects LCP.
  - Framer animates the orbit:
    1. The SVG ellipse draws in (`pathLength` 0→1, 1.6s).
    2. A glowing node then loops along it.
    3. The copper glow "breathes" (opacity 0.6↔1, 6s).
- Interactions:
  - Cards lift on hover (`y: -4`) and their border brightens.
  - The Service Explorer panel swaps with `AnimatePresence mode="wait"`: a crossfade plus an 8px slide.
  - The mobile menu slides and fades in.
  - The "How We Work" connecting line grows on scroll (`useScroll` + `useTransform`).
- Header: transparent over the hero. After 8px of scroll it becomes `ink-950/80` with `backdrop-blur` and a bottom hairline.

### 3.6 Accessibility (required)
- Use semantic landmarks, include a skip-to-content link, and keep one H1 per page.
- Focus ring is visible everywhere: 2px `copper-400` outline with a 2px offset.
- Keyboard support:
  - Services dropdown: a `<button aria-expanded>` that opens on click or Enter, closes on Esc and returns focus.
  - Service Explorer: tab semantics with arrow-key navigation.
  - Accordions: native `<details>`/`<summary>` or equivalent ARIA.
- Tap targets are at least 44×44px. Every form field has a label, inline errors and `aria-describedby`.
- All informative images have alt text; decorative SVG (orbit, glow) is `aria-hidden`.

---

## 4. Brand assets
- The provided logo is a 1254×1254 square with an **opaque charcoal background**. On the warm-black site it would show as a visible box.
  - **Interim**: crop it to the wordmark and remove the background (ImageMagick or `sharp`). Save to `public/brand/logo.png` (horizontal wordmark) and `public/brand/logo-mark.png` (the "AI" robot mark, for favicon and OG image).
  - **Request from client**: a transparent PNG or SVG master of the logo.
- **Founder photo**: the hero reference shows the founder standing in the glow, and the PDF requires a real photo. Needed: a transparent cut-out PNG, at least 1600px tall, saved to `public/images/founder.png`. Until then, the hero shows the orbit and globe visual only. No stock person.
- Favicon and app icons come from `logo-mark` (`app/icon.png`, `app/apple-icon.png`).

---

## 5. Information architecture

### 5.1 Header
```
[Logo]   Home   Services ▾   Case Studies   Blog        [ Book a Consultation → ]
```
- The PDF's nav uses "Book a Schedule". This doc uses its suggested, more natural label: **Book a Consultation**. It's an outlined copper button that links to `/book`.
- The active link is `copper-400` with a 2px underline, as in the reference.
- **Services dropdown (mega-menu)**:
  - Two columns listing the 6 services, each with icon, title and one-liner.
  - Bottom row: **AIDMBD Learning Academy →** (`/academy`).
- **Mobile**: a hamburger opens a full-height sheet with Services as an accordion, large tap targets and the Book button pinned at the bottom.
- About, Team, Careers, Contact, FAQ and Policies live in the **footer**.
- **Student Login** is added only when the course portal launches (Phase 7).

### 5.2 Routes

| Route | Page | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Home | 1 |
| `/services` | All services | 2 |
| `/services/[slug]` | Service detail ×6 | 2 |
| `/book` | Book a Consultation (request flow) | 3 |
| `/academy` | Academy home with filters | 4 |
| `/academy/[category]` | Category ×4 | 4 |
| `/academy/courses/[slug]` | Course detail | 4 |
| `/case-studies`, `/case-studies/[slug]` | Case studies | 5 |
| `/blog`, `/blog/[slug]` | Blog | 5 |
| `/about` | About, Founder, Team (`#team`) | 5 |
| `/careers`, `/contact`, `/faq` | Company and support pages | 5 |
| `/policies/[slug]` | privacy · terms · refund · cancellation | 5 |
| `/certificate-verification` | Certificate lookup | 7 |
| `/login`, `/dashboard/*`, `/admin/*` | Student portal and admin | 7 |

**Rule:** every dynamic route exports `generateStaticParams` from the content files, so all pages prerender. Unknown slugs call `notFound()`. Filters (Academy, Case Studies, Blog categories) run **client-side with component state**, not `searchParams`, so the pages stay static.

### 5.3 Footer

| Column | Links |
|---|---|
| Company | About · Team · Careers · Contact |
| Services | The 6 service detail pages |
| Academy | Courses · Live Batches · Recorded Courses |
| Support | FAQ · Student Support · Certificate Verification (later) |
| Policies | Privacy · Terms · Refund · Cancellation |
| Connect | Business email · official social profiles (LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook) |

The bottom bar has the logo, the tagline "PRACTICAL AI. REAL BUSINESS IMPACT.", social icons, © year, and a language switch placeholder (later).

Each type shows its duration, its fee (if any), its format (online or in person) and **what to prepare**.

### 9.2 Fields
- **Required**:
  - Full Name and Email
  - Booking Type and Service/Course Interest
  - Preferred Date and Available Time Slot
  - Timezone (auto-detected with `Intl`, editable)
  - Short Description
- **Optional**, shown depending on the booking type:

5. Fill in details.
6. Review the booking.
7. Confirmation.
8. Calendar invite and meeting link.
9. Reminder.
10. Reschedule or cancel.

- **Phase 3 builds steps 1–7 as "Request a Meeting"**, because no live calendar is connected yet:
  - It's a multi-step client form with a Server Action that validates on the server, plus a honeypot field for spam.
  - The success screen says **"Request received — we'll confirm by email."** It must never say "confirmed" before the team confirms.
  - `?type=` pre-selects the type. Read it with `useSearchParams` inside a `Suspense` boundary.
- **Later**: calendar integration for steps 8–10 (invites, reminders, reschedule/cancel).
- The booking page states the format, free/paid status, duration, timezone, preparation and cancellation/rescheduling terms.

## 14. Content and trust rules
- No fabricated testimonials, client logos or statistics. Every one must be real, permission-based and verifiable.
- Self-made work is labelled **Demo Project**.
- No guarantees about research publication, leads or sales. Describe scope, measurement and reporting instead.
- Fees are always separate from third-party costs: ad budget, tool/API fees, hosting and domain.
- Pricing states its deliverables, revisions, support period and additional costs.
- Course language and currency (BDT/USD) are always stated.
- **All copy lives in `content/*.ts` or MDX**, never hard-coded in components. That makes Bangla translation and a later CMS straightforward.

## 15. Technical requirements

### 15.1 Next.js 16.4 rules
| Rule | Read first |
|---|---|
| `params` is a Promise. `await` it in pages, and type it with `PageProps<'/services/[slug]'>`. In layouts, don't await params at the top level. | `03-api-reference/03-file-conventions/dynamic-routes.md`, `page.md` |
| Cache Components is on. Pages are prerendered, so avoid request-time APIs at the top level. Every `[slug]` route exports `generateStaticParams`. | `01-getting-started/08-caching.md`, `02-guides/keeping-pages-static.md`, `04-functions/generate-static-params.md` |
| The Header uses `usePathname` for the active link. This is fine on static routes. If a route with unknown dynamic params is ever added, wrap the Header nav in `Suspense`. | `04-functions/use-pathname.md` |
| `useSearchParams` always goes inside `<Suspense>`. | `04-functions/use-search-params.md` |
| Server Components by default. Add `"use client"` only to interactive or animated leaves (motion primitives, Service Explorer, menus, forms). | `01-getting-started/05-server-and-client-components.md` |
| `next/image`: `priority` is deprecated. For the hero image use `preload` or `fetchPriority="high"`, and always set `sizes`. | `02-components/image.md` |
| Fonts via `next/font/google`, exposed as CSS variables in `@theme`. | `01-getting-started/13-fonts.md` |
| Use the `metadata` / `generateMetadata` exports, plus `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts`, `opengraph-image` and Organization JSON-LD. | `01-getting-started/14-metadata-and-og-images.md`, `02-guides/json-ld.md` |
| Forms use Server Actions with server-side validation. | `02-guides/forms.md`, `02-guides/server-actions.md` |
| Tailwind v4 is configured in CSS only (`@import "tailwindcss"` + `@theme`). | `01-getting-started/11-css.md` |

### 15.2 Quality bar
- Responsive layout, optimized images and fast loading. Targets: Lighthouse **≥90 performance** and **≥95 accessibility, best practices and SEO** on Home and on one service page.
- Readable contrast, labelled forms and full keyboard navigation.
- Spam protection on forms (honeypot, plus a rate limit when the backend arrives). Secrets stay in environment variables, server-only.
- Custom `not-found.tsx`. No broken internal links. Error monitoring and backups come with the backend phase.
- Unique title and description for every page, a sitemap and social preview images.
- Later (Phase 7): secure authentication, role-based access and controlled course access.

Conventions:
- One component per file. Use named exports, except the `default` exports that pages and layouts require.
- Type props explicitly. Content types live in `lib/types.ts`.
- Sections receive data from `content/` and stay presentational.

## 17. Build plan, step by step

### Phase 0: Foundation
1. `npm i motion lucide-react`.
2. Brand assets: crop the logo and remove its background (§4). Add `icon.png` and `apple-icon.png`.
3. `globals.css`:
   - Add the `@theme` tokens (§3.2), gradients and glow utilities.
   - Add the hero fade-up keyframes and focus-ring base styles.
   - Remove the light/dark media switch.
4. `layout.tsx`:
   - Load Plus Jakarta Sans and set the site metadata (title template `%s · AIDMBD International Ltd`).
   - Set `<html className="bg-ink-950 text-titanium-50">` and add `MotionProvider` and the skip link.
5. UI primitives: `Container`, `Section`, `SectionHeading`, `Button` (primary/outline/link, with arrow), `Card`, `Badge`, `Accordion`.
6. Motion primitives: `Reveal`, `Stagger`, `Orbit` (SVG ellipse with `pathLength` draw and a travelling glow node).
7. Content files: `site.ts`, `services.ts` (all of §7.2), `faqs.ts`, `caseStudies.ts` (demo seeds), `academy.ts`.

**Done when**: `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass, and a temporary page renders the tokens, buttons and cards correctly.

### Phase 1: Landing page (priority)
Build in order, and check each section at 360, 768, 1280 and 1440 before moving on:
1. Header, desktop dropdown and mobile menu.
2. Hero and Quick Cards.
3. Services section and Service Explorer.
4. Case Studies preview.
5. Academy preview.
6. How We Work.
7. About preview.
8. Testimonials (conditional).
9. Latest Blog (placeholder posts until Phase 5).
10. FAQ.
11. Booking CTA band.
12. Footer.

**Done when**:
- All links resolve (to real pages, `#anchors`, or the `/book` stub).
- Keyboard pass is clean, and reduced motion is respected.
- Lighthouse meets §15.2.
- No console errors.

### Phase 2: Service pages
`/services` (overview grid) and `/services/[slug]` following the §7.1 template, with `generateStaticParams` and `generateMetadata`.

**Done when**: all 6 render from data with their correct CTAs and service-specific notes.

### Phase 3: Booking
Build `/book` as the multi-step request flow (§9) with a Server Action. Delivery defaults to email.

**Done when**:
- Required fields are validated on client and server.
- Conditional fields show for each type, and `?type=` pre-selects.
- The honeypot blocks bots.
- The success copy never says "confirmed".

### Phase 4: Academy
`/academy` (client-side filters), the category pages, and course detail pages with all 13 fields. Unready courses show **Join Waitlist**.

### Phase 5: Supporting pages
Case Studies (filters and detail pages), Blog (MDX, categories), About (with `#team`), Careers (no-openings state and talent pool), Contact, FAQ, Policies.

### Phase 6: SEO and polish
- `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, OG images, JSON-LD, `not-found.tsx`.
- Full accessibility and Lighthouse pass, plus an image optimization review.
- Optional: start the Bangla version through a `[lang]` segment (read `02-guides/internationalization.md`). The language switch opens the same page in the other language.

### Phase 7: Platform (after backend decisions)
Auth and student dashboard, payments, admin panel, calendar booking (invites, reminders, reschedule), careers applications, certificate verification, community and newsletter, client portal.

**First launch (from the PDF)**:
- Pages: Home, the 6 service pages, Academy, ready course pages, Case Studies, About, Blog, Booking, Contact, Policies. That's Phases 0–6.
- If recorded courses are sold directly at launch, payments and student access must ship too. Otherwise use inquiry or waitlist.

## 18. Needed from the client before or while building
- [ ] Final logo as a transparent PNG/SVG, and confirmation of the brand colours
- [ ] Company and founder introduction, plus the founder's real photo (transparent cut-out for the hero)
- [ ] Service scope, packages and support terms
- [ ] At least 2–3 strong projects or demos, with screenshots
- [ ] Course syllabi, preview lessons and instructor details (photo, bio)
- [ ] Testimonials, with permission
- [ ] Business email, contact details and meeting availability
- [ ] Decisions on payment, refund and cancellation
- [ ] Domain and the necessary account access

## 19. Open decisions (and the defaults used until decided)
| Decision | Default |
|---|---|
| Launch language | English first. All copy kept in `content/` so Bangla can be added later. |
| Where booking and contact submissions go | Server Action → email (e.g. Resend). Calendar integration later. |
| Content source | Typed TS files plus MDX for the blog. Admin/CMS in Phase 7. |
| Recorded course sales at launch | Waitlist or inquiry until payment and auth are chosen |
| Hosting | Vercel (native Next.js). Netlify, where the old site lives, also works. |
| Primary nav CTA label | "Book a Consultation", the PDF's suggested natural label |

## 20. Success metrics
| Area | Measure |
|---|---|
| Services | Qualified inquiries, booked meetings, accepted proposals |
| Academy | Preview views, enrollments, completion rate, refund rate |
| Content | Relevant traffic and its contribution to inquiries and enrollments |
| Support | Response time, unresolved requests |
